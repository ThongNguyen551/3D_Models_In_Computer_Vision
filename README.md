# 3D_Models_In_Computer_Vision
This repository includes all my lab exercise in the course 3D Models in Computer Vision at University Jean Monnet - University of Lyon for my 2nd semester of Erasmus Mundus Master Program. There are 4 labs during this course, which allow me to understand big topics in 3D Models in Computer Vision, which are Corner Detection, Camera Calibration, Epipolar Geometry, and 3D Reconstruction. 

## 1. Harris Corner Detector

Learn how to detect corners in an image and understand the importance of the different steps involved in corner detection using the Harris algorithm. This algorithm is based on the image gradient. A zone of interest such as a corner or an edge corresponds to a large change in appearance, impacting the value of the gradient. Harris corner detection applies a mathematical approach to this
property in order to detect corners

## 2. Camera Calibration

The objective of this exercise session is to learn and perform camera calibration using MATLAB and CalTech calibration toolboxes. As a part of this lab session I will do the following task sequentially:
- Learn the basic usage of a famous camera calibration toolboxes.
- Calibrate single camera using the toolbox.
- Calibrate a stereo system the toolbox.

Toolbox: Follow the link below in order to download and learn the usage of "CalTech" camera calibration toolbox. http://www.vision.caltech.edu/bouguetj/calib_doc/

Data: Besides CalTech Images, other images are obtained from the stereo system of our lab. A set of 51 images are given. However, you can consider reduced number (at least 20) of images from them (in such case make sure that you have selected consistent pair of images for both cameras) to perform the tasks of this lab.

## 3. Epipolar Geometry

The objective of this exercise session is to implement the knowledge acquired on the stereo vision. The major focus will be on epipolar geometry and triangulation based 3D reconstruction.

## 4. 3D Reconstruction

The objective of this exercise session is to reconstruct a 3D scene, knowing the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of each camera that the stereovision system used.
